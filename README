Installation
=======
Add-to Gemfile following lines:

    gem 'spree_contact_us', :git => 'git://github.com/sbeam/spree_contact_us.git'
    gem "recaptcha", :require => "recaptcha/rails" # if you are using reCAPTCHA

Run: bundle install
Run: bundle exec rails g spree_contact_us:install
Run: bundle exec rake db:migrate

* Set mail method in admin area (/admin/mail_methods). Otherwise will not work!

Upgrading
=======

Run: bundle exec rake db:migrate

Contact forms get spammed a lot
=======
Includes support for reCAPTCHA http://www.google.com/recaptcha which can be configured
in the admin under Configuration -> Inquiries.

A "Honeypot" CAPTCHA is also available. This is a fairly effective method and requires zero
effort on the part of the user. An empty form field is included in the form -
if it has anything in it, a stupid bot has probably filled it out. It does
assume that everyone is using a CSS-capable, visual user agent that will hide
the field using display:none


TESTING
=======
$ bundle exec rake common:test_app
$ bundle exec rake spec
